# D-Day-Counter <br /><br />
## What does it do? <br />
Title explains everything. It's a D-Day counter. <br />
User can input year, month, and date to see how long it's left until D-day from now. <br />
Input year, month, and date then click 'Start Count Down' button then it'll start counting down. <br />
It stores date into the local storage, so that refreshing or leaving and coming back doesn't affect counting down. <br />
User can input another D-Day date and click 'Start Count Down' button apply new D-Day. <br />
If user wants to reset, simply click 'Timer Reset' button. <br /><br />
